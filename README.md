Frontend

First I have created ApiKey and Azure end point in the Azure portal

used React to build up the front end

used fetch request and Azure end point to send the image URL uploaded by the user for the image analysis by Azure and for receiving the response.

used Axios to pass some data from the response received from Azure to the backend to get the filtered list of cars.

created a Navbar using Bootstrap

created a function to get the filtered data from the backend when a button is clicked.

also added a function to store the selected items using spread operator which is useful for a final selection.

Added some css to make the front end attractive.
